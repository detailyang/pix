pix: CSS pixel art
=========================

One Day my friend show me the CSS magic about [Bat Pixel Art Animation on one Div](http://codepen.io/timothyguo/pen/jbarzP). It's so cool. But What the hell it is and How to work for this? It depends on the CSS3 box-shadow and animation.

Using the box-shadow you can render any image:)

#Install

````bash
pip install pix-css
````

#Usage

````bash
pix --scale=1 --width=1 ./bat.gif > art.html
````

now open the art.html on you browser, enjoy the magic:)
